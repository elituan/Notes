* Just as RNN were build for time-dependent data and CNN for image data, GCN are type of Geometric Deep Learning built for graphs and neuron networks.

## Take away
1. The Euclidean domain (2 D like text, image, audio, number) and non-Euclidean domain have diffrent rules. And non-Euclidean con convey more information.
2. Geometric deep learning is the class of deep leanring that can operate the non-euclidean domain with the goal of teaching model how to perform prediction and classificaiton on relational datatypes
3. The difference between traditional Deep Learning and Geometric Deep Learning can be illustrated by imagining the accuracy between scanning an image of a person versus scanning the surface of the person themselves.
4. In traditional Deep Learning, dimensionality is directly correlated with the number of features in the data whereas in Geometric Deep Learning, it refers to the type of the data itself, not the number of features it has.
